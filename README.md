# Open Beyblade X Battlepass

Beyblade RPM Counter

## About

During a trip to Japan, the new generation of Beyblade reignited my passion for Beyblade, along with my group of friends. 

In the Japanese market, there is a device that attaches to the launcher and measures the power of the launch. Unfortunately, it only works with the Japanese app.

One day, thanks to this [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeybladeX/comments/1gapboj/what_is_this_white_part_on_the_launcher/), we realized that it was possible to count the rotations of the launcher using an IR sensor.

## How It Works:

The launcher has a disk that rotates with the Beyblade. Half of the disk is black, which allows the IR sensor to count the rotations.

The GIF shows a brief example of the IR sensor lighting up when the disk turns white.
